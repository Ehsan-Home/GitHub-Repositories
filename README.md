# GitHub Favorite Repositories Inventory (GitHubventory) üì¶

I implemented a web app that you can search different repositories of a user and save them!
You can see the demo in [YouTube](https://youtu.be/culW-7x3f5I)

## Tech-stack üñ≤Ô∏è

Front-end:

- [Soild.js](https://www.solidjs.com/)
- TypeScript
- Bootstrap
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/)

This web app uses local-storage to store and retrieve saved repositories.

## Future Tasks üîÆ

- ‚úÖ Record YouTube video.
- ‚úÖ Release the app.
- Improve UI
- Add homepage

## PNPM Usage

Those templates dependencies are maintained via [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) via `pnpm up -Lri`.

This is the reason you see a `pnpm-lock.yaml`. That being said, any package manager will work. This file can be safely be removed once you clone a template.

```bash
$ npm install # or pnpm install or yarn install
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm dev` or `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles Solid in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Deployment

You can deploy the `dist` folder to any static host provider (netlify, surge, now, etc.)
